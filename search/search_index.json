The name is influenced from fastai , not my first course in deep learning but my favorite course. The site is organized by the architecture I am working on. For each architecture, there will be two projects - a Tiny one and a Paper one. The Tiny one is a basic recreation of the signature model. The Paper one is the implementation of a state-of-the-art model. You can find the Jupyter Notebook files in the Github repo.","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#about","text":"The site contains all my personal learning projects for computer vision.
