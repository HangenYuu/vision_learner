# vision_learner
This is the repo to contain all my personal learning projects for computer vision. The name is influenced from [fastai course](course.fast.ai/), not my first course in deep learning but my favorite course.

The structure of the repo is telltale based on the name of the folders: the data are all in the `DATA` folder, the `PROLOGUE` folder with the `Routine` Notebook introducing you to PyTorch routine is where you should start, and all the projects are in the architecture.

For each architecture, there will be two projects - a Tiny one and a Paper one. The Tiny one is a basic recreation of the signature of the model. The Paper one is the implementation of a SOTA model, may or may not be for the original task.

Each project will have the Notebook file and HTML file rendered by Quarto.
