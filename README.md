# vision_learner
This is the repo to contain all my personal learning projects for computer vision. The name is influenced from [fastai](https://course.fast.ai/), not my first course in deep learning but my favorite course.

The structure of the repo is telltale based on the name of the folders: the `PROLOGUE` folder with the `Routine` Notebook introducing you to PyTorch routine is where you should start, and all the projects are in the `ACHITECTURE` folder. I wanted to include the data for the project itself here, but they may surpass the 1GB limit of Github so I leave it out. I will try to use data freely available, such as PyTorch own datasets, or Kaggle datasets. If I use data of my own, I will try to put them on Kaggle before downloading. Anything else will go to the `README.md` file in the `DATA` folder.

For each architecture, there will be two projects - a Tiny one and a Paper one. The Tiny one is a basic recreation of the signature of the model. The Paper one is the implementation of a SOTA model, may or may not be for the original task.

Each project will have the Notebook file, HTML file (rendered by Quarto if possible), and PDF file.
