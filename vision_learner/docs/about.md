# About
The site contains all my personal learning projects for computer vision. The name is influenced from [fastai](https://course.fast.ai/), not my first course in deep learning but my favorite course.

The site is organized by the architecture I am working on. For each architecture, there will be two projects - a Tiny one and a Paper one. The Tiny one is a basic recreation of the signature model. The Paper one is the implementation of a state-of-the-art model.

You can find the Jupyter Notebook files in the Github repo.
